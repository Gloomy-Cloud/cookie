Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined.
In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, coconut oil, tahini, water, and vanilla until smooth.
Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and use a spatula to combine. 
Fold in the chocolate chips. Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop the dough onto the baking sheets. 
Bake, one sheet at a time, for 12 to 14 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes.
